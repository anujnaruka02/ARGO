First Phase

Main.cpp contains the C++ code used to link C++ and MySQL according to the database and the table that I have created for storing the data;
On executing the C++ code, the seller can enter the details by checking it from the inventory table to ensure if the given vehicle is available or not.
All of this data is stored inside a table which is stored in a centralised database called minproj in my case.

Image below showcases the window that is used by the seller. I have randomly added some values in it.

The next image showcases two tables, one is the table named MAIN_SERVER that stores details from every seller and the second one is called INVENTORY that updates the status of each seller's shop.
